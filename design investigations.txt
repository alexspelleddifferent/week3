the two sites I found were the apple website and the yale art school website.
I think the apple website is really well designed - it is designed to be scrolled through, and one element flows into the next as you scroll through the website.
Specifically their "product" page, so for example the one for the newest iphone was what i looked at
https://www.apple.com/iphone-14-pro/ - the screenshot doesn't do it justice, it's the movement of the page that i really like
For bad websites i picked the yale art school one, just because it's so... noisy. really hard to tell what the main elements of the website are, what the background is, what the menu options are.
The link to that one is:
https://www.art.yale.edu/
Runner up for bad website design: the mobile version of MCTC's navigate website. absolutely horrible to navigate. couldn't get a screenshot but maybe youve seen it
